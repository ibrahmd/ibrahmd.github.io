[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stony Brook University under the supervision of Prof. IV Ramakrishnan. My work focuses on building interpretable machine learning models for sequence early prediction tasks. My research aims to design systems that predict events earlier without sacrificing accuracy. In healthcare problems, where my work is mainly applied, earlier prediction can help medical professionals intervene early and better allocate resources.\nDuring my Ph.D., I did two internships at Google and one at Twitter. I was glad to work on various exciting machine learning problems in ranking and recommender systems. My internship projects spanned multiple application domains, such as ads, shopping, and online articles.\nBefore starting my Ph.D., I received my B.E. in Computer and Communications at the American University of Beirut.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stony Brook University under the supervision of Prof. IV Ramakrishnan.
